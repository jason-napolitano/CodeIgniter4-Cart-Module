# CodeIgniter4-Cart-Module
> This is a `composer` installable, CodeIgniter 4 module that is nearly a direct port of the Codeigniter 3 Cart Library Class.
> Of course, this has been mildly updated and is consistent with the new version of the framework.
> 
> This means that instead of just being a _class_ that you can use in your projects, this library
> has been updated with Namespaces, has been refactored to adhere to the CodeIgniter style guide 
> and also has been built to use CodeIgniter 4's Service Container to allow for a shared Cart instance 
> across your application.  
> 
> More detailed documentation can be found [here](https://codeigniter.com/userguide3/libraries/cart.html). Please
> note that the documentation is for the CodeIgniter 3 library but the fundamentals and inner workings of the 
> library are still identical. The most notable changes are how you use it (read below) and to return 
> the total items in your cart, you now call `$cart->totalItems()` instead of `$this->cart->total_items()`.
> 
> Please take note that there are no tests for this package since it is just a port from an existing Codeigniter library and works 
> just the same.

## Installation:
 - Install via composer `composer require jason-napolitano/codeigniter4-cart-module`
 - Add it to the `$psr4` array in `app/Config/Autoload.php`:
 ```php
$psr4 = [
    'CodeIgniterCart' => ROOTPATH . 'vendor/jason-napolitano/codeigniter4-cart-module/src'

    // OTHER PSR4 ENTRIES
];
``` 
  
## Usage
 ```php
 // Call the cart service
 $cart = \Config\Services::cart();
 
 // Insert an array of values
 $cart->insert(array(
    'id'      => 'sku_1234ABCD',
    'qty'     => 1,
    'price'   => '19.56',
    'name'    => 'T-Shirt',
    'options' => array('Size' => 'L', 'Color' => 'Red')
));
 
 // Update an array of values
 $cart->update(array(
    'rowid'   => '4166b0e7fc8446e81e16883e9a812db8',
    'id'      => 'sku_1234ABCD',
    'qty'     => 3,
    'price'   => '24.89',
    'name'    => 'T-Shirt',
    'options' => array('Size' => 'L', 'Color' => 'Red')
));

// Get the total items. Formerly known as total_items()
$cart->totalItems();

// Remove an item using its `rowid`
$cart->remove('4166b0e7fc8446e81e16883e9a812db8');
   
// Clear the shopping cart
$cart->destroy();

// Get the cart contents as an array
$cart->contents();
```
